### Overview ###

The objective of `slidify` is to make it easy to create reproducible HTML5 presentations from `.Rmd` files. 

The guiding philosophy of `slidify` is to completely separate writing of content from its rendering, so that content can be written once in `R Markdown`, and rendered as an `HTML5` presentation using any of the `HTML5` slide frameworks supported.

# Several HTML5 slide frameworks exist... #

### Installation ###

This package is not available on `CRAN` as yet. A development version can be installed from `github` using the `devtools` package. 

```{r eval = F}
library(devtools)
install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
```

In addition to `slidify`, you would also need to install development versions of `knitr`, `whisker` and `markdown`.

```{r eval = F}
install_github('knitr', 'yihui')
install_github('whisker', 'edwindj')
install_github('markdown', 'rstudio')
```

### Motivation ###


---

### Usage ###

`slidify` is designed to make it very easy for a HTML novice to generate a crisp, visually appealing `HTML5` slide deck. You can do it in just three steps!

..ul: build

* Write your source file in [R Markdown](http://goo.gl/KKdaf)
* Separate your slides using a horizontal rule `---`
* Run `slidify("slides.Rmd")` to generate your slide deck.

---

### Framework ###

`slidify` allows you to render your slides using several HTML5 slide frameworks. Currently supported frameworks are:

* [deck.js][1]
* [dzslides][2]
* [html5slides][3]
* [shower][4]
* [slidy][5]

Extending `slidify` to accommodate other frameworks is pretty straightforward. The plan is to support more frameworks over time.

---

### Theme ###

The `theme` option lets you style your slides. Currently, this option is available only for `deck.js` which allows the following themes

* web-2.0
* swiss
* neon

Themes are just `css` files. So it is easy to extend this option to the other frameworks if you can write css. 

---

### Transition ###

The `transition` option allows you to define the transition between slides. Currently, this option is available only for `deck.js` which allows the following transitions

* horizontal-slide [default]
* vertical-slide
* fade

Please consult [deck.js](http://goo.gl/UFthM) documentation for more information on `themes` and `transitions`


---

### Highlighter ###

`slidify` is designed to be modular and syntax highlighting is one module. Currently two options are supported

* `js` 
* `R`

The `js` option does client side highlighting using the javascript library [highlight.js][5], while the `R` option generates a static page, highlighted using the R package [highlight][6]. 

You will notice that the quality of highlighting for `R` code is better when done with the `R` package, rather than `highlight.js`.

### Highlight Style ###

`slidify` allows you complete control over how you want to style your source code using `css`. The styles currently supported depend on the `highlighter` chosen.

* `js` see documentation for [highlight.js](http://goo.gl/uEJj)
* `R`  type `knit_theme[['get']]()` to see available styles


In order to use the `R` option, you need to include the line `opts_knit$set(out.format = 'html')` inside your `.Rmd` file. This is required to fool `knitr` into highlighting source code. Specifying it outside the document does not work as `knitr` resets it to `md` as soon as it sees the `.Rmd` extension.

---

### Math ###

This option allows you to write math in your presentations. `slidify` automatically adds a link to the `js` files from Mathjax CDN. Here are Maxwell's Equations from the Mathjax website.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\   \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0 \end{aligned}
$$

A cross-product formula, again from the Mathjax website

$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0
\end{vmatrix}
$$

---

### Animated Lists ###

It is easy to animate a list by adding the class specified `build`. For example, consider the `markdown` source below

    ..ul: build

    * Point 1
    * Point 2
    * Point 3

It produces the slide

..ul: build

* Point 1
* Point 2
* Point 3
    
---

### Issues ###

Different `HTML5` slide generation frameworks style the same elements differently. Moreover, they use different classes to define incremental builds, full page images etc.

As a result, a slide deck that looks visually appealing in one framework, may not look as nice in another. It will require carefully overriding the `css` definitions across frameworks so as to reach some kind of consistency.

The long-term goal of `slidify` is to be able to truly stand by the "write once, style as you like" idea.
